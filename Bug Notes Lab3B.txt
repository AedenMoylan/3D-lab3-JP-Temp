1) collisions between player and powerup do not work. Powerup collides with
every other object except player for some reason.

2) collisions between playerBullet and enemy3 do not work. enemy3 collides
with other objects though for some reason

3) enemy3 shoots bullets low on the y-axis and therefore can't hit the player

4) enemy3 does not move on the z-axis.

(PowerUp effect is added to the player by pressing space)
